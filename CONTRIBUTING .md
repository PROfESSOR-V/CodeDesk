##  üíº Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our **Code of Conduct**.  
Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## üóÇ Monorepo Structure

| Directory  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `backend/` | **Node.js + Express** REST API with **Supabase** integration |
| `client/`  | **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** frontend |

##  üõ† Getting Started

### Fork and Clone the Repository
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CodeDesk.git
   cd CodeDesk
```
3. Add the upstream repository:
```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-username/CodeDesk.git
```
4. Create a branch for your work:
```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Setting up the Development Environment
1. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
# For backend
cd backend
npm install

# For frontend
cd client
npm install
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Process

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/*` - For new features
- `fix/*` - For bug fixes
- `docs/*` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/*` - For code refactoring
- `test/*` - For adding or modifying tests

Example: `feature/user-authentication`

## üìùCommit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools 

```
Example:

1. feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

2. Add JWT token generation

3. Implement token verification middleware

4. Add refresh token functionality

Closes #123
```

##  üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR
1. Sync your fork with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
2. Ensure your feature branch is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```
3. Run all tests locally and fix any issues
4. Review your changes and clean up your commits

### Creating the Pull Request
1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```
2. Go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link any related issues using keywords (Fixes #123, Closes #456)
5. Request review from relevant team members

### PR Requirements
1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update documentation in the `/docs` directory if needed
3. Ensure all tests pass and add new tests for new features
4. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
5. PR title must follow the commit message format:
   ```
   type(scope): brief description
   ```
   Example: `feat(auth): implement Google Auth login`

### Review Process
1. Automated checks must pass:
   - Linting
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Build verification
2. At least one maintainer must review and approve
3. Address all review comments and update PR
4. Maintain a constructive dialogue during review

### After PR Approval
1. Squash commits if requested by reviewer
2. Ensure branch is up-to-date with main
3. Wait for final confirmation to merge
